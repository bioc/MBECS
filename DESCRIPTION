Description: The Microbiome Batch Effect Correction Suite (MBECS) provides a set of functions to evaluate and mitigate unwated noise due to processing in batches. To that end it incorporates a host of batch correcting algorithms (BECA) from various packages. In addition it offers a correction and reporting pipeline that provides a preliminary look at the characteristics of a data-set before and after correcting for batch effects.
